SCIM-Client
===========

Simple Cloud Identity Management (SCIM) is a standard REST/JSON API to standardize User and Group CRUD (Create, read, update, delete). For developers and system administrators, it reduces the cost and complexity of user management operations by providing a common user schema and extension model, as well as binding documents to provide patterns for exchanging this schema using standard protocols. 

Detailed specifications for SCIM can be found at [http://www.simplecloud.info](http://www.simplecloud.info). 

In Gluu's implementation, we have User, Group and Bulk operations. Below are the Gluu implementations for SCIM:
